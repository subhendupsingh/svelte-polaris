# Svelte Polaris

Svelte Polaris is the port of [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris-react.shopify.com) to Svelte by [spsbuilds](https://x.com/spsbuilds)

**Note**: This is a WIP, expect and report bugs.

This port has similar API to the original react components with same attributes, making it easier for you to copy and paste from the Shopify polaris documentation or from other react examples.

## Installation
```
npm i svelte-polaris
```

or

```
pnpm add svelte-polaris
```
