TextContainer provides optimal line length and spacing for readable text content. It ensures text remains readable by constraining line length and providing appropriate spacing for different types of content.

## Examples

### Basic text container

Use TextContainer to improve text readability with optimal line length.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Preview">
```svelte
<script>
  import { TextContainer, Card, Text } from 'svelte-polaris';
</script>

<Card>
  <TextContainer>
    <Text variant="headingLg" as="h2">Welcome to our platform</Text>
    <Text>
      This is a longer paragraph of text that demonstrates how TextContainer 
      helps maintain optimal line length for better readability. The container 
      automatically constrains the width to ensure text doesn't become too wide 
      to read comfortably, especially on larger screens.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      Multiple paragraphs work well within TextContainer, maintaining consistent 
      spacing and readability throughout the content. This makes it perfect for 
      articles, descriptions, and other text-heavy content.
    </Text>
  </TextContainer>
</Card>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Code">
```svelte
<script>
  import { TextContainer, Card, Text } from 'svelte-polaris';
</script>

    </Text>
  </TextContainer>
</Card>
```
</TabItem>

### Text container with spacing

Use spacing prop to control the vertical spacing between text elements.

    <Text>
      E-commerce analytics provide valuable insights into customer behavior, 
      sales performance, and business growth opportunities. By understanding 
      these metrics, businesses can make data-driven decisions that improve 
      their bottom line.

    <Text variant="headingLg" as="h2">Key Metrics to Track</Text>
    
    <Text>
      The most important metrics for e-commerce businesses include conversion 
      rate, average order value, customer lifetime value, and cart abandonment 
      rate. Each of these provides unique insights into different aspects of 
      your business performance.
    </Text>
    
    <Text variant="headingMd" as="h3">Conversion Rate</Text>
    
    <Text>
      Conversion rate measures the percentage of visitors who complete a desired 
      action, such as making a purchase. A higher conversion rate indicates that 
      your website effectively persuades visitors to become customers.
    </Text>
    
    <Divider />
    
    <Text variant="headingMd" as="h3">Average Order Value</Text>
    
    <Text>
      Average order value (AOV) represents the average amount spent per order. 
      Increasing AOV through upselling, cross-selling, and bundling strategies 
      can significantly impact revenue without requiring more customers.

### Responsive text container

TextContainer automatically adapts to different screen sizes for optimal readability.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Preview">
```svelte
<script>
  import { TextContainer, Card, Text, BlockStack } from 'svelte-polaris';
</script>

<BlockStack gap="400">
  <Card>
    <TextContainer>
      <Text variant="headingLg" as="h2">Responsive Design</Text>
      <Text>
        TextContainer automatically adjusts its maximum width based on the 
        screen size to ensure optimal readability across all devices. On 
        larger screens, it prevents text from becoming too wide, while on 
        smaller screens, it uses the available space efficiently.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        This responsive behavior ensures that your content remains readable 
        and engaging regardless of how users access your application, whether 
        on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.
      </Text>
    </TextContainer>
  </Card>
  
  <Card>
    <Text variant="headingMd" as="h3">Without TextContainer</Text>
    <Text>
      This text doesn't use TextContainer, so it can become very wide on larger 
      screens, making it harder to read. Long lines of text can strain the eyes 
      and reduce reading comprehension, especially when the line length exceeds 
      the optimal range of 45-75 characters per line.

- Use consistent spacing throughout your application
- Test readability across different screen sizes and devices

## Typography guidelines

- Aim for 45-75 characters per line for optimal readability
- Use appropriate line height (1.4-1.6) for body text
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors
- Choose fonts that are legible at various sizes
- Maintain consistent vertical rhythm throughout your content

## Accessibility

- TextContainer maintains proper semantic structure for screen readers
